                  When you hear the word entrepreneurship, what is the first the thing that comes to mind? For me it's the business reality TV show  ‘The Apprentice’, consisting of  Alan Sugar's
                  cutthroat rebuttals, the highly competitive atmosphere and the
                  many tears shed from the participants who have had their
                  business dreams crushed. So when it came to navigating the topic
                  of self-employment, that was the lens I saw it through: intimidating.

              <p class="pp">
                <strong>  Is that cut-throat
                view the same idea that
                you have about entrepreneurship?
                Do you have an idea in your head that you have to first take a
                massive loan out of the bank or does the responsibility of being a
                sole trader put you off?

                it is safe to say that the options are few and far between.
                The majority of people feel more comfortable or feel that it is more
                convenient to work for a business under a boss. So, what is it about
                the prospect of self-employment that puts some people off then?

                “I’m tired of seeing entrepreneurs preach that you’re not passionate
                 about your idea unless you’re willing to give up everything for it.
                Plenty of people start a successful business without ever going into
                debt. We’ve always run our business as a blend
of consulting and software. The consulting made us profitable

      <h4>Question 1- Do you think you were prepared for the workplace after
        leaving the safe hub of 15 plus years in education?
    Does getting a 1st class or A*  always guarantee you an easy passage in
    the job market? </h4>

      <p class="bxp"> <strong>'It not that simple at all.'' That was something I realised
        first within the first month of leaving university.
        I graduated with a 2:2, If I wanted to get into engineering I'm already starting
        at the bottom against people with higher degrees. What I find crazy is
        when you first get into an industry, they will either teach you new things or
        they will tell you the thing that you spend learning for three years at university,
        you actually don't need it for this job or it its just filler to get you into a
        position in a lot of cases. I found this really annoying because, you start to think
        what was the point of paying this much money at university every year and then at the
        end of it you're not even guaranteed a job. It makes no sense. It's sad that
        universities have not really grasped that. Nowadays experience is valued
        over qualifications with a rise in apprenticeships and schemes that allow people to get
        into the workforce a lot easier without worrying about having to get a 1st class
        Your education is great but, if you didn't do any extra-curricular activities
        now to a  lot of employers you look like a robot because you've been working so much at
        your degree, but so has everybody else, other people have been able to do
        things on the side and learn certain transferable skills from that. So educational
        achievement is not the only option, education only teaches you one thing, but life and
        all of its experiences teaches you a wide array of other things. What you make
        out of your time a university and for yourself too helps you. hUndreds and thousands of
        people are applying for the same jobs, you need to find different ways to make you stand
        out. Some in an hiring team once told me that he has clones of the same set of people;
        can people stop saying the same thing in applications these conventional applications
        go straight into the bin.  Nowadays a lot of companies are seeking people
        who have started things up themselves because it shows that they have initiative and drive
        and passion as well.

    <div class="Q2 item">
      <h4>Question 2 -Do you ever regret taking the entrepreneur route?</h4>

      <p class="bxp"> <strong> Not at all funnily enough. Ever since graduation, I've had loads of convsersations
          with my Mum, she has seen both the highs and the lows. I think a lot of people
          think that a entrepreneurship is synonymous with getting money but that
          is not always the case. People forget that it takes a lot of diligence, hard work and
          patience. You're not really working a 9-5 you're working an 8 to 11pm because you're
          are working for yourself.There is a lot of groundwork that needs to take place, in my
          case I had to sacrifice things like going out to see friends etcetera. Take a sick day at
        a normal job you get holiday/sick pay, if you do that as an entrepreneur, that's coming
      out your own pocket. I do not regret this route, it's been hard and there have been a
      lot of learning curves, this may be the most financially tight I've ever been,
      but it has the happiest that I've ever been." </strong>
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="Q3 item">
      <h4>Question 3 - Is it more financially rewarding or stable than not
          being an entrepreneur</h4>

      <p class="bxp"> <strong> I'll probably say yes, it depends,  because at first when you start a business there are a lot of
            expenses in order for you to start. So you have to register your business, whether you want it
            limited or self-employed. There is a lot of money that goes into your initial startup, it might take
            you a while to attract a solid customer base. In my experiences because I'm a freelancer, it did take me a
            while to get customers and especially because i wasn't charging so much at first. At first in terms of money
            I was probably making a lot less than somebody who had a full-time job, even know sometimes I am when I do
            the hours and the math. But eventually the more you work at it and the more people know of you and you build
            that loyal customer base, eventually it can be more profitable than doing a graduate full-time job. Especially when
            you get to that level, as a video designer and editor you can charge hundreds of pounds for a couple hours of editing.
            In terms of hourly pay, someone who works for a company will usually get paid less. </strong>

    <div class="Q4 item">
            <h4> Question 4 - What are some of the hardship that you struggled
              with </h4>

      <p class="bxp"> <strong> Not having any money.... not having any money for sure. There are times
            your working and you haven't got anything in and the money is supposed to
            come at the end of the project. So I remember when I had one of my first
            company jobs; this was for a magazine company and they needed content to be
            edited. This was something that would have taken a day or two to edit but
            because of a lack of communication it prolonged to a month long. I was
            waiting out for this money to come so I could pay for things, as it was coming
            towards Christmas too. But because the lack of communication as so poor
            it wasn't until January that I got paid. Also when things seemed a bit
            quiet, it did take a while to build a clientele and publicity for myself
            I would have questions like: what gonna happen, am I ever going to be able
            to get a job, will I get a chance to work with some people, how am I going to
            survive? Another hardship was dealing with indecisive clients changing their
            minds over designs, when you have to make revisions and changes things, it cuts
            into your hours If you have already set them a set price that set price might
            as well be you working for free, because you've spent too many more ridiculous
            hours, that could have been avoided if they had been more detailed with their
            proposals. <strong>

  Rebecca graduated from the University of Hertfordshire with a degree in
  Business management. The flexibility that an entrepreneurial business offers,
  gives an owner the opportunity to break out of the mold of being able to only
  qualify and apply to jobs that require a background in a subject-specific degree.
<br>
<br>
  Taking the alternative route of an entrepreneurship means that an individual
  can explore unlimited business ventures from a range of different industries.
<br>
<br>
  Why?
  <br>
  <br>
  It is because they are the ones who determine what they want to do.
<br>
<br>
  Along with that, the entrepreneurial route can provide an individual with many
   benefits that a normal 9-5 job cannot give, here are some of the perks that
    Rebecca has through being an entrepreneur:

<strong>Social benefits –</strong> Envoys can network to improve their own social conditions as
well as those of others. Working to create enabling environments and fight
inequalities, their contributions and collective dedication can support health,
 housing, education, living standards and the social dimensions of all in the
 global society, whilst creating wealth and celebrating success.

<br>
 <strong>Economic benefits –</strong> Envoys can use the network to share ideas with others, to
promote their products or to attract funds. They can also identify organisations
 and individuals who can help or mentor them. But as with the social benefits,
 the economic benefits that can be gained by changing the enabling environment
 can have gained for all in the global society.
<br>

<strong>Environmental benefits –</strong> Envoys are ‘virtual’ and work in the most
environmentally friendly way possible. But they also need to be present to
promote issues direct to policymakers, education and the media. The green
economy and climate change mitigation is being worked on fastest and most
efficiently at the grassroots level and a serious dimension of the Envoys
commitment is to support this sector as there is only one planet!
